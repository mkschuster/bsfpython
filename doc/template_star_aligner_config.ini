[bsf.analyses.star.Star]

# (Meaningful) Project Name (mandatory)
#
# The project name also defines the project directory name under the
# standard path obtained from bsf.standards.StandardFilePath.get_projects(absolute=True).

project_name =

# Analysis Input and Output Directories (optional)
#
# Analysis input and output directories can override standard paths
# from bsf.Configuration. Both, user and variable expansion gets
# applied. If, at that point, the path is still relative, default
# directory paths from bsf.standards.StandardFilePath get prepended. These
# options can therefore remain empty in typical cases and the output
# directory will be created in the standard location from the project
# name.
#
# input_directory =
# output_directory =

# Debug Level (optional)
#
# A level of extra information can be set via an integer,
# the higher, the more verbose.
#
# Defaults to 0.
#
# debug = 0

# Genome Assembly Version (optional)
#
# The genome assembly version corresponds to a resource directory
# holding the genome sequence and indices. It is also the name of a new
# sub-directory under the analysis output directory and links to UCSC
# Genome Browser Track Hubs.
#
# Defaults to the 'genome' option in the [transcriptome_{version}]
# configuration section.
#
# genome_version =

# Operator e-Mail Address (optional)
#
# An operator e-mail address is required for UCSC Genome Browser Track Hubs
#
# Defaults to the 'e_mail' option in the [operator] configuration section.
#
# e_mail =

# Sample Annotation Sheet (optional)
#
# The Sample Annotation Sheet (SAS) specifies a hierarchy of BSF
# ProcessedRunFolder, BSF Project, BSF Sample, BSF PairedReads and BSF
# Reads objects. Additionally, the file type (i.e. 'CASAVA' or
# 'External') can be specified for automatic discovery of objects in
# CASAVA-processed run folders.
#
# Defaults to file name "{project_name}_{star}_samples.csv"
# in the current working directory.
#
# sas_file =

# Transcriptome Version (mandatory)
#
# The transcriptome version

transcriptome_version =

# Transcriptome Index Directory (optional)
#
# Defaults to the transcriptome-specific sub-directory in the
# 'star' option of the [indices] configuration section.
#
# index_directory =

# Transcriptome Annotation GTF File (optional)
#
# Defaults to the GTF file in the transcriptome-specific sub-directory in the
# 'star' option in the [indices] configuration section.
#
# transcriptome_gtf =

# Two-Pass Mapping (optional)
#
# Defaults to 'none', in which no two-pass mapping will be performed.
# Can also be 'basic' for the 'STARaligner --twopassMode Basic' option and
# 'full' for complete re-mapping on the basis of 'SJ.out.tab' splice junction files.
# Please note that 'full' is not implemented, yet.
#
# two_pass_mapping =

# Skip Picard MarkDuplicates (optional)
#
# Skip running Picard MarkDuplicates.
#
# Defaults to false so that Picard MarkDuplicates is run
#
# skip_mark_duplicates =

# Picard Java Class Path (optional)
#
# The class path to the Java Archive (JAR) files for the Picard package.
#
# Defaults to the value of bsf.standards.JavaClassPath.get_picard().
#
# classpath_picard =

# A [bsf.analysis.Stage] section is usually read from the central configuration file.
# Please see the doc/template_bsfpython.ini file for a description of
# configuration options that can occur in Analysis-specific configuration
# sections below.
