[bsf.analyses.fastqc.FastQC]

# (Meaningful) Project Name (mandatory)
#
# The project name also defines the project directory name under the
# analysis output directory defined via the "output_directory" option below.

project_name =

# Cache Directory Path (optional)
#
# The cache directory is used by the bsf.procedure.Runnable and its
# sub-classes to copy certain files to a local cache such as the shared memory
# or the temporary directory for performance reasons.
#
# Defaults to the value of bsf.standards.StandardFilePath.get_cache(),
# which is based on the "cache" option of the "directories" section of the
# global configuration file. If set to an empty string, a cache directory will
# not be used.
#
# cache_directory =

# Input Directory Path (optional)
#
# The analysis input directory, which is used to initialise the NGS Collection
# and thus to look up Sample, ReadGroup and Reads file paths.
#
# Defaults to the value of bsf.standards.StandardFilePath.get_samples(absolute=True),
# which is configured via the "sample" option in the "directories" section of the
# global configuration file.
#
# Both, user and variable expansion gets applied. If, at that point, the path
# is still relative, the above default directory path gets prepended.
#
# input_directory =

# Output Directory Path (optional)
#
# The analysis output directory.
# Both, user and variable expansion gets applied. If, at that point, the path
# is still relative, default directory paths from
# bsf.standards.StandardFilePath get prepended.
#
# Defaults to the value of bsf.standards.StandardFilePath.get_projects(absolute=True),
# which is based on the "projects" option of the "directories" section of the
# global configuration file.
#
# Both, user and variable expansion gets applied. If, at that point, the path
# is still relative, the above default directory path gets prepended.
#
# output_directory =

# Report Style File Path (optional)
#
# A custom Cascading Style Sheet file path.
# The custom style sheet will be included in <style type="text/css"> HTML elements in the
# HTML <header> element and replace the one coded into the bsf.analysis.Analysis module.
#
# Defaults to an empty value, upon which a style sheet coded into the bsf.analysis.Analysis module will be included.
#
# report_style_path =

# Report Header File Path (optional)
#
# A fragment of HTML including complete <p> elements to be included in the header section of the Analysis report.
#
# Defaults to an empty value.
#
# report_header_path =

# Report Footer File Path (optional)
#
# A fragment of HTML including complete <p> elements to be included in the footer section of the Analysis report.
#
# Defaults to an empty value.
#
# report_footer_path =

# Genome Assembly Version (mandatory|optional)
#
# For genome-based analyses, the genome assembly version the particular analysis should be based on.
# The genome assembly version corresponds to a configuration section in the
# global configuration file and is linked to a resource directory holding the
# genome sequence, index and accessory files.
# It is also the name of a new sub-directory under the analysis output directory
# and links to UCSC Genome Browser Track Hubs.
#
# genome_version =

# Sample Annotation Sheet (mandatory)
#
# The Sample Annotation Sheet (SAS) specifies a hierarchy of
# ProcessedRunFolder, Project, Sample, PairedReads and Reads objects.
# Additionally, the file type (i.e. 'CASAVA' or 'External') can be specified
# for automatic discovery of objects in CASAVA-processed run folders.
#
# Defaults to file name "<project_name>_<genome_version>_fastqc_samples.csv"
# in the current working directory.
#
# sas_file =

# Sample Annotation Prefix (optional)
#
# An optional sample annotation sheet prefix gets prepended to column names.
# It can be useful to distinguish e.g. 'Control Sample' objects from
# 'Treatment Sample' objects defined within the same sample annotation sheet.
#
# Defaults to an empty string, which implies no additional prefix.
#
# sas_prefix =

# Operator e-Mail Address (optional)
#
# An operator e-mail address mainly required for UCSC Genome Browser Track Hubs.
#
# Defaults to the value of bsf.standards.Operator.get_email(), which is based on
# the "e_mail" option of the "operator" section of the global configuration file.
#
# e_mail =

# Debug Level (optional)
#
# A level of extra information can be set via an integer,
# the higher, the more verbose.
#
# Defaults to 0.
#
# debug =

# A [bsf.analysis.Stage] section is usually read from the central configuration file.
# Please see the doc/template_bsfpython.ini file for a description of
# configuration options that can occur in Analysis-specific configuration
# sections below.
