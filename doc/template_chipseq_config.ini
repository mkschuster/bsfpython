[bsf.analyses.chipseq.ChIPSeq]

# (Meaningful) Project Name (mandatory)
#
# The project name also defines the project directory name under the
# standard path obtained from bsf.standards.StandardFilePath.get_projects(absolute=True).

project_name =

# Analysis Input and Output Directories (optional)
#
# Analysis input and output directories can override standard paths
# from bsf.Configuration. Both, user and variable expansion gets
# applied. If, at that point, the path is still relative, default
# directory paths from bsf.standards.StandardFilePath get prepended. These
# options can therefore remain empty in typical cases and the output
# directory will be created in the standard location from the project
# name.
#
# input_directory =
# output_directory =

# Debug Level (optional)
#
# A level of extra information can be set via an integer,
# the higher, the more verbose.
#
# Defaults to 0.
#
# debug = 0

# Genome Assembly Version (optional)
#
# The genome assembly version corresponds to a resource directory
# holding the genome sequence and BWA indices, as well as
# reference transcript annotation files. It is also the name of a new
# sub-directory under the analysis output directory and links to UCSC
# Genome Browser Track Hubs.
#
# Defaults to the genome assembly version associated with the transcriptome version.
#
# genome_version =

# Operator e-Mail Address (optional)
#
# An operator e-mail address is required for UCSC Genome Browser Track Hubs
#
# Defaults to the 'e_mail' option in the [operator] configuration section.
#
# e_mail =

# Sample Annotation Sheet (mandatory)
#
# The Sample Annotation Sheet (SAS) specifies a hierarchy of BSF
# ProcessedRunFolder, BSF Project, BSF Sample, BSF PairedReads and BSF
# Reads objects. Additionally, the file type (i.e. 'CASAVA' or
# 'External') can be specified for automatic discovery of objects in
# CASAVA-processed run folders.

sas_file =

# Sample Annotation Prefix (optional)
#
# An optional sample annotation sheet prefix gets prepended to column
# names. It is useful to distinguish e.g. 'Control Sample' objects
# from 'Treatment Sample' objects defined on the same sample
# annotation sheet.
#
# sas_prefix =

# Sample Comparison File (mandatory)
#
# The comparison file specifies, which samples or groups should be
# compared.

cmp_file =

# Align BSF Sample replicates in groups:
#   true (i.e. all replicates as a single TopHat process) or
#   false (i.e. each BSF Sample replicate as a separate TopHat process)

replicate_grouping = true

# UCSC Genome Browser Track Hub default RGB colour (optional)
#
# Defaults to '0,0,0' i.e. black
#
# colour_default =

# Default factor (optional)
#
# Defaults to 'OTHER'
#
# factor_default =

# Genome sizes (optional)
#
# The genome_sizes are required for the BED to BigBed conversion.
#
# Defaults to the FASTA index file defined for the genome.
#
# genome_sizes =

# Reference Transcriptome Version (mandatory)
#
# The reference transcriptome version corresponds to a resource directory
# holding the transcriptome annotation files.

transcriptome_version =

# Reference Transcriptome GTF (optional)
#
# A GTF file defines the reference transcriptome. If the path is not absolute,
# standard directory paths from bsf.Configuration get prepended.
#
# Defaults to a transcriptome_version.basic.gtf or transcriptome_version.gtf file.
#
# transcriptome_gtf =

# Reference Transcriptome TxDb (optional)
#
# A Bioconductor TxDb (SQLite) transcriptome database. If the path is not absolute,
# standard directory paths from bsf.Configuration get prepended.
#
# Defaults to a transcriptome_version.basic.sqlite or transcriptome_version.sqlite file.
#
# transcriptome_txdb =

# A [bsf.analysis.Stage] section is usually read from the central configuration file.
# Please see the doc/template_bsfpython.ini file for a descripton of
# configuration options that can occur in Analysis-specific configuration
# sections below.
