# BSF GNU Bourne-Again (Bash) script to convert an (unmapped) BAM or SAM file
# into FASTQ files via Picard SamToFastq before compressing with GNU Gzip.
#
# Usage: bsf_bam2fastq.sh input_file sam_to_fastq_jar [output_directory]
#   input_file:        The path to the BAM or SAM file to be converted
#   sam_to_fastq_jar:  File path to Java Archive (JAR) (SamToFastq.jar)
#   output_directory:  The directory in which to place the FASTQ files.
#                      Defaults to the directory name of the input_file parameter.
